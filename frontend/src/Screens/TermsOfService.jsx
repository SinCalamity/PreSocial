        <p><strong>PreSocial is a membership platform that helps connect fans with creators they love.
        Our mission is to put creators first, and these terms attempt to do that.   
        We know that most people skim through terms of use because they're boring, 
        but we have done everything we can to make this easy to get through. Above every section, 
        we'll summarize the most important parts, but these summaries are not legally binding, 
        so please look at the full version of the text for a complete understanding of these terms.

            <p><i> To summarize: by using PreSocial you agree to these terms.</i>

            These are PreSocial's Terms of Use, and they apply to all users of the PreSocial platform. “We,” “our,” and “us” 
            refer to PreSocial, Inc. “PreSocial” refers to this platform and the services offered by us, including the PreSocial iOS app, 
            the PreSocial Android app, PreSocial APIs, PreSocial embeds, www.presocial.com, and PreSocial's other websites. By using 
            PreSocial, you agree to these terms and to the other policies we post, including the Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and 
            Benefit Guidelines. Please read them carefully and let us know if you have any questions. For information about our data 
            practices, please see our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy.

            <p><i>To summarize: You must be at least 13 years old to use PreSocial. You are responsible for your account.</i>

            When you create an account, you must provide us with accurate information, in good faith, and you agree to keep your 
            nformation updated if it changes. To create an account or otherwise use PreSocial, you must be at least 13 years old and 
            you must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may 
            allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf). You must be at least 18 years old or have your parent's or legal 
            guardian's permission to have a creator page on PreSocial or to purchase an offering or subscription on PreSocial. You must be 
            at least 18 years old to subscribe to an Adult/18+ creator or purchase an offering related to such a creator. 
            You are responsible for anything that occurs when anyone is signed in to your account, as well as the security of the account. 
            Please contact us immediately if you believe your account is compromised. You can learn more about security in our 
            Security Policy.</p>

            You are responsible for all activity on your account. If you violate our terms or policies, then we may terminate your account. 
            Don't do anything illegal, abusive towards others, that abuses PreSocial in a technical way, or that exploits PreSocial in an 
            unintended manner that is detrimental to us, like using PreSocial as a storage platform. If you are a creator earning money on 
            PreSocial, we may be exposed to risk based on what you do with those funds. As a result, we may also look at what you do 
            outside of PreSocial. You can find more detailed information in the Community Guidelines and Security Policy. These terms and 
            our policies cover most issues, but, if you find a new and creative way to hurt PreSocial or our community, we may take 
            action to prevent it.</p>

                </div>
                <p><i>To summarize: A creator is someone who creates a page on PreSocial to engage with supporters who purchase memberships or 
                    offerings on PreSocial to support the creator's creations. There are a lot of details below involving payments, 
                    fees, taxes, and restrictions that you should read in full if you are a creator.</i></p>
                <h5>Creator Page</h5>
                <p>To become a creator, simply launch your page to start your offering or membership. When you join PreSocial, you 
                    become part of the PreSocial community. You can use creator tools that we provide to, among other things, showcase 
                    your creations, engage with the PreSocial community, and provide merchandise to supporters through our merch service. 
                    Memberships are for your most passionate fans. On PreSocial, you can provide your supporters something exciting that 
                    gives them special benefits they want, including additional access, merchandise, exclusive creations, and engaging 
                    community experiences. In turn, you will receive loyal support from your supporters, and revenue from memberships and 
                    offerings that supporters have purchased on PreSocial.</p>
                <h5>Payments</h5>
                <p>As a creator, you may make offerings available on PreSocial on a one-time basis and may make memberships available on 
                    PreSocial on an automatically-renewing subscription basis. Where supported and as applicable, we automatically convert 
                    the prices of offerings and subscriptions into a supporter's local currency based on a currency conversion rate that may 
                    be determined at our sole discretion. You can learn more here. Also, where supported and subject to your controls as 
                    applicable, we may automatically increase the prices of offerings to supporters to account for the fees imposed by the 
                    platforms (like the App Store) on which the associated purchases were made in a manner that may be determined at our 
                    sole discretion. You can learn more here. We typically handle payments issues such as fraud, chargebacks, and 
                    resolution of payments disputes, though, for purchases made through certain platforms (like the App Store), the 
                    associated platforms may handle these payments issues. We try to provide timely access to the funds you've earned on 
                    PreSocial based on the level and type of PreSocial service you select. Purchases made on certain platforms (like the App 
                    Store) and different levels and types of PreSocial service may have different timelines associated with funds 
                    becoming accessible to you and/or may require that reserves of funds are withheld from becoming accessible to you. 
                    You can learn more here. You may, however, occasionally experience further delays in accessing these funds. We may also 
                    block or withhold access to these funds for violations of our terms or policies or for compliance reasons, including 
                    collecting tax reporting information. When this happens, we try to communicate the reason to you promptly. If you 
                    have questions about access to funds being blocked or withheld, please reach out to us. In order to protect creators, 
                    we may block supporters' payments if we believe them to be fraudulent. Sometimes activities like refunds to supporters and 
                    chargebacks from supporters can put your account balance into the negative and any fees you've incurred from PreSocial or 
                    the platforms (like the App Store) on which the purchases were made, as described below, may not be refunded to you 
                    when such refunds and chargebacks are processed. If your balance becomes negative, we reserve the right to recover 
                    those funds from future payments. To make sure PreSocial is a safe community for everyone, we are required to 
                    have all creators sharing sexually explicit creations or creations that include nudity agree to certain additional 
                    requirements. If you are an Adult/ 18+ creator, then you agree to verify that you are over the age of 18 through the
                    means requested by us, to verify that each person depicted in your creations is over the age of 18, and to obtain each
                    such persons' written consent to participate in your creations. A consent form template that you may use for this 
                    purpose is located in our Help Center, where you may get additional information about these requirements. You agree 
                    that you will promptly provide us with this proof of age verification and consent if we request it.</p>
                    <h5>Fees</h5>
                    <p>As a creator, there are fees associated with your offerings and paid memberships on PreSocialn. The general nature 
                        of these fees is summarized below, but the most current information is found in our Help Center. These fees may 
                        increase with notice to you and may vary depending on the level and type of PreSocial service you select, including 
                        whether you choose to use PreSocial's paid membership service, free membership service, and/or service for 
                        facilitating one-time purchases:</p>
                    <ul>The platform fee, which may include a flat fee and/or is calculated as a percentage of successfully processed 
                        payments. For service levels and types that include merch, please note that, in addition to the platform fee for 
                        using the merch service, we also charge you for the cost of the merchandise itself based on the quantity and SKUs 
                        of the associated items</ul>
                    <ul>Feature-specific fees, which may arise from the use of particular PreSocial features and may include a flat fee and/or 
                        are calculated as a percentage of successfully processed payments;</ul>
                    <ul>The payment processing fee, which is calculated as a percentage of successfully processed payments and a flat fee per
                        successfully processed payment and relates to the cost of processing payments from supporter, including recurring 
                        billing, recovering declined payments, and fighting fraud;</ul>
                    <ul>The payout fee, which is a fee for transferring money you've earned on PreSocial to your specified payout method 
                        and may vary based on your specified payout method; and</ul> 
                    <ul>The currency conversion fee, which is calculated as a percentage of successfully processed payments made in a 
                        currency other than your payout currency.</ul>
                    <p>You can see the fees for any offerings and subscriptions on your creator dashboard, though please note that this 
                        dashboard does not list the payout fee described above. Also, as described above, when offerings are purchased on 
                        certain platforms (like the App Store), those platforms may impose fees for those purchases. We endeavor to provide 
                        you with information about those fees in your creator dashboard and, where supported and subject to your controls 
                        as applicable, PreSocial may automatically increase the prices of offerings to supporters to account for those fees.</p>
                    <p>If a supporter pays in a currency that is different from the currency associated with their payment instrument, then the
                        financial institution associated with that payment instrument may charge them a foreign transaction fee for that 
                        payment. We are not applying this fee and have no control over it, have no knowledge of whether the fee is applied, 
                        and do not receive any of the funds from that fee.</p>
                    <p>Even if a supporter pays in the same currency as the currency associated with their payment instrument, when a supporter's
                        payment is processed in a country different from the one associated with their payment instrument, then the financial
                        institution associated with that payment instrument may charge them a foreign transaction fee for that payment. We 
                        are not applying this fee, have no knowledge of whether the fee is applied, and do not receive any of the funds 
                        from that fee, but our choices about payment processing may impact or otherwise give rise to this fee. </p>
                    <h5>Tax</h5>
                    <p>In order to satisfy our tax obligations, we collect tax identification information and, in certain circumstances, 
                        report this information and earnings to tax authorities as legally required. For example, if you are located in the 
                        United States or are a United States citizen who has earned $600 or more, PreSocial is required to issue you a Form 
                        1099-K at year end. For purposes of Forms 1099-K, we treat all creator earnings as earned for the sales of goods 
                        or services. You are responsible for reporting any income, withholding, or other earnings-based taxes which may be 
                        due as a result of money you've earned on PreSocial. You can learn more in our Tax Help Center. </p>
                    <p>We are additionally responsible for a number of transactional taxes across the world. These include, but are not 
                        limited to, Valued Added Tax (“VAT”), Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) and other local service or sales taxes in 
                        non-US locations (collectively referred to as “VAT”), as well as state sales tax in the United States. 
                        To learn more about how we handle transaction taxes, please check our VAT guide and other Help Center articles. In 
                        locales where we are required to collect transaction tax from supporters, invoices presented to and payments processed 
                        from supporters will include the tier or custom payment amount plus the applicable tax. Applicable tax will be charged 
                        in addition to the price of a relevant transaction based upon the benefits that you indicate that you will be 
                        offering. We will use the benefit categories that you assign to your membership or offering to calculate, collect, 
                        and remit the applicable taxes. You are responsible for ensuring that all of your benefits are properly categorized 
                        using good faith efforts and to the best of your ability using the available tools. You agree to provide accurate 
                        information when you are engaging with the tier tools, sales tax weighting tools and, generally, when listing and 
                        categorizing benefits transferred within membership tiers and offerings. Once settled, the tax amount will be 
                        automatically deducted, and we will remit directly to the applicable taxing authority. A record of the transaction 
                        tax portion of the payment will be available on your earnings details page.</p>
                    <p>Amounts payable under this agreement between a creator and PreSocial may include VAT or sales tax where applicable. 
                        Please refer to our Tax Help Center in this regard. You agree that you will provide us with any information and 
                        documents for accurate tax determination and compliance, where and as we request or as otherwise required.</p>
                    <h5>Restrictions</h5>
                    <p>We don't allow creations and benefits that violate our terms or policies. You can learn more by visiting our 
                        Community Guidelines and Benefit Guidelines. A high level summary of those rules is that we don't allow:</p>
                        <ul>illegal creations or benefits;</ul>
                        <ul>creations or benefits that are abusive towards other people;</ul>
                        <ul>creations or benefits that are misleading or deceptive;</ul>
                        <ul>creations or benefits that use others' intellectual property, unless you have written permission to use it, 
                        or your use is protected as fair use; or</ul>
                        <ul>creations or benefits with real people engaging in sexual acts.</ul>
                    <p>If you are an Adult/ 18+ creator, then certain features associated with the the level and type of PreSocial service 
                        you select may not be available to you.</p>
                    <p>If your fans include people under the age of 18, then please remind them that they need their parent's or legal 
                        guardian's permission to purchase an offering or membership subscription on PreSocial, and that those under the age 
                        of 13 cannot use PreSocial. We are not required to allow any particular person or group of persons to access an 
                        offering, be a supporter or otherwise access PreSocial services.</p>
                    <p>As a creator, you are also responsible for keeping supporter data safe. You agree to our Data Processing Agreement 
                        (DPA) that we sometimes refer to as the Creator Privacy Promise. </p>
                    <p>An account is tied to your creative output and cannot be sold or transferred for use by another creator.</p>
                    <p>We are constantly experimenting with product features to make PreSocial better and may add, remove, or test features
                        with a subset of creators. Access to these features is not guaranteed and may not be subject to your control. 
                        Instead, we may enable and disable these early-access, beta, or test features at our sole discretion. 
                        These features may also be subject to additional restrictions and limitations, including some that we describe 
                        in our Help Center. </p>

                <p><i>To summarize: A supporter is someone who subscribes and/or makes a purchase on PreSocial, which may come with special 
                    benefits from creators they love. Through a subscription or offering on PreSocial, supporters may receive benefits and 
                    directly interact with creators using tools supplied by us, and, through PreSocial, have the opportunity to engage with 
                    a community of supporter and creators.</i></p>
                <p>As a supporter, you're supporting a creator and may receive special benefits like shoutouts, exclusive creations, or 
                    merchandise. You pay on a one-time or automatically-renewing subscription basis as specified; PreSocial is the billing 
                    entity that is associated with this charge. If your primary payment method fails and you've configured one or more 
                    backup payment methods, then we will charge those backup payment methods based on that configuration.</p>
                <p>The timing and amount of each subscription or offering depends on the type of subscription or offering you select and 
                    the creator you support. You can see the details prior to purchasing the offering or starting the subscription and you 
                    can view all your active subscriptions and your billing history</p>
                <p>To become a supporter, simply subscribe or purchase a paid subscription or other offering on PreSocial. Subject to these terms
                    and full payment of all applicable charges, to the extent a subscription or offering includes access to one or more 
                    of a creator's creations, you receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited license 
                    to access and view those creations for your own private, personal, non-promotional, non-commercial use. Creations you 
                    gain access to in this manner will generally continue to be available to you, but may become unavailable at any time as 
                    described below.</p>
                <p>In addition to one-time purchases, there are three types of paid, automatically renewing subscriptions offered on 
                    PreSocial. One is a monthly subscription where you pay per month. The second is a per-creation subscription where you pay 
                    per-creation posted by the creator. You can set a limit on the number of creations you pay for in a single month under 
                    this per-creation subscription model. The third is an annual subscription, where you pay for a year of access up front, 
                    typically at a discounted rate. Not all types of membership subscriptions are offered by all creators and the then 
                    current subscription options for a given creator will be presented to you prior to entering into the membership.</p>
                <p>Each type of paid subscription automatically renews monthly (for monthly and per-creation memberships) or annually 
                    (for annual memberships) until you cancel via your membership settings. If your subscription includes a free trial, 
                    then, unless you cancel via your membership settings before your free trial ends, you will be charged for the first 
                    time after the specified free trial period ends and you'll start an automatically renewing paid subscription on PreSocial 
                    of the type you selected. Your recurring charge date may be earlier than the date you first subscribed for reasons 
                    including, for example, differences between your timezone and the timezone in which our billing systems operate and 
                    your most recent previous charge date being earlier due to variances in the length of months. The amount you are 
                    charged for a membership subscription may increase with notice to you. This enables creators to, for example, adjust 
                    membership prices to account for increased costs, new or different benefits, or other changed circumstances, just like 
                    any other business. Similarly, this enables PreSocial to, for example, account for new currency exchange rates by 
                    refreshing the conversion rate applied when a supporter pays in a currency different than the one chosen by the creator. 
                    PreSocial does not control the applicable tax that you may be charged and this amount may increase without notice 
                    to you.</p>
                <p>You may cancel your free trial or recurring payments at any time, as described above.  For monthly and annual memberships, 
                    canceling or lowering the tier support of your membership will impact your next recurring charge. For per-creation 
                    memberships, lowering the tier support of your membership will impact your next per-creation charge and canceling your 
                    membership will go into effect before your next per-creation charge. Annual memberships may be canceled or increased, 
                    but not lowered, and increasing your payment to a higher tier level in an annual membership will go into effect in the 
                    current payment term. When you increase your payment during the current payment term, you may be credited for any payment 
                    already made in that term. For example, if you upgrade from a monthly membership to an annual membership, then the amount 
                    you already paid for that particular month may be credited toward, and thereby reduce the first year cost of, the annual 
                    membership.</p>
                <p>Canceling your membership or lowering the tier support below the applicable threshold may result in your loss of access 
                    to membership subscription benefits, including a creator's supporter-only posts and other benefits. You may also lose access 
                    to offerings you've purchased and membership subscription benefits if, for example and as applicable, your payment method 
                    fails, we terminate your account, the creator blocks you, the creator stops making offerings and/or memberships available 
                    on PreSocial, the creator deletes their PreSocial account, the creator changes who has access to an offering and/or 
                    membership, the creator removes a post or offering from their PreSocial account, we remove the creator from PreSocial, we 
                    change who has access to an offering and/or membership, or we remove a post or offering from from a creator's PreSocial 
                    account. We are not required to allow you to access an offering, be a supporter of, or to otherwise interact with any 
                    particular creator.</p>
                <p>Membership subscriptions and offerings vary and we have limited control over the quality and specific benefits. We 
                    attempt to screen for fraudulent creator pages, but cannot guarantee the identity of creators or the validity of any 
                    claims they make. We appreciate your help reporting suspicious creator pages so we can keep the PreSocial 
                    community safe.</p>
                <p>If you are located in a jurisdiction in which PreSocial is required to charge and collect tax, for example VAT or sales tax, 
                    then this tax is added to the total charge. Except in limited circumstances, this tax is shown to you when purchasing 
                    an offering or starting a paid subscription. PreSocial remits all tax collected to the applicable taxing authority. 
                    As tax is largely dependent on your location, you agree to keep your location complete and up to date in order to 
                    enable accurate collection of taxes.</p>
                <p>If you pay in a currency that is different from the currency associated with your payment instrument, then the financial 
                    institution associated with that payment instrument may charge you a foreign transaction fee for that payment. We are 
                    not applying this fee and have no control over it, have no knowledge of whether the fee is applied, and do not 
                    receive any of the funds from that fee.</p>
                <p>Even if you pay in the same currency as the currency associated with your payment instrument, when your payment is 
                    processed in a country different from the one associated with your payment instrument, then the financial institution 
                    associated with that payment instrument may charge you a foreign transaction fee for that payment. We are not applying 
                    this fee, have no knowledge of whether the fee is applied, and do not receive any of the funds from that fee, but 
                    our choices about payment processing may impact or otherwise give rise to this fee.</p>
                <p>We are constantly experimenting with product features to make PreSocial better and may add, remove, or test features 
                    with a subset of supporters. Access to these features is not guaranteed and may not be subject to your control. 
                    Instead, we may enable and disable these early-access, beta, or test features at our sole discretion. These features 
                    may also be subject to additional restrictions and limitations, including some that we describe in our Help Center.</p>
                <p><b>Refunds</b>. Our policy is not to provide refunds, including if you lose access to offerings and/or 
                membership subscription benefits as described above, though we may allow for some exceptions where refunds are granted 
                at our sole discretion. If you made a purchase on certain platforms (like the App Store), then PreSocial may not be able to 
                address any associated refund requests, and you may need to contact those platforms directly. You can learn more here.</p>

                <p><i>To summarize: We may look at some pages and posts on PreSocial and review reported pages to identify potential 
                    violations of these terms and our policies.</i></p>
                <p>We look at some pages and posts on PreSocial to enforce these terms and our policies, including our Community Guidelines
                    and Benefit Guidelines. We also investigate reports of potential violations. These investigations may take a while to 
                    resolve and, primarily because PreSocial may be exposed to risk based on what is done with funds earned on PreSocial, may 
                    include reviewing activity outside of PreSocial.</p>
                <p>In most situations, we will work with creators and supporters to resolve any potential policy violations and allow the 
                    creator or supporter to continue using PreSocial. PreSocial may terminate creator or supporter accounts when we believe it is 
                    necessary to protect creators, supporters, PreSocial, or the broader community, but it is not an action we take lightly</p>
                <p>PreSocial reserves the right to remove a creator or supporter from participating in annual memberships. Removing a creator 
                    from participation in annual memberships will remove the option for further supporters to purchase annual subscriptions 
                    on PreSocial for that creator. Removing a supporter from participation in annual memberships will prohibit that supporter from 
                    purchasing further annual membership subscriptions on PreSocial for any creator. This will not, however, result in an 
                    automatic removal of the creator or supporter from PreSocial, unless there is an independent basis for that removal.</p>
                <p>Please let us know if you see potential violations of our Community Guidelines. You can learn how to report them here.</p>
                <p>As a global company based in the Philippines with operations in other countries, we must comply with economic sanctions 
                    and trade restrictions, including those implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the United States 
                    Department of the Treasury. This means that we cannot take part in transactions that involve designated people, places, or 
                    items that originate from those places, as determined by agencies like OFAC. You can read our Sanctions Policy here.</p>

                    <p>These terms and any referenced policies are the entire agreement between you and us, supersede all prior
                        agreements, and don't create any partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee 
                        relationship between you and us. If any provision of these terms is held to be unenforceable, then that 
                        provision is modified to the extent necessary to enforce it. If a provision cannot be modified to make it 
                        enforceable, then it is severed from these terms, and all other provisions remain in force. If either party 
                        fails to enforce a right provided by these terms, then it does not waive the ability to enforce any rights in 
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>We may sometimes make changes to these terms. If we make a change to these terms that, in our sole discretion, is

                        means you accept the new terms or policies.</p>
